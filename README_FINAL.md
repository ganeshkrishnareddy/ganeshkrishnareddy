### 🚀 Professional Summary

I reduce real-world security risk by identifying authorization flaws, hardening systems, and validating security controls in production-like environments. My approach bridges the gap between building robust web applications and securing the digital infrastructure they live on.

- 🛡️ **Security Outcomes**: Identified and mitigated authorization flaws, insecure configurations, and data exposure risks across diverse systems.
- 💻 **Engineering Impact**: Architecting scalable, secure web applications with a focus on DevSecOps and infrastructure-as-code.
- 📉 **Core Metric**: Reduced production infrastructure setup time by 75% using automation scripts during my Red Hat tenure.
