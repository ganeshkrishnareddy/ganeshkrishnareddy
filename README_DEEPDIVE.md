### 🚀 Professional Summary

I design, build, and secure modern web applications by combining full-stack engineering with application security, Linux hardening, and automation. I reduce real-world security risk by identifying authorization flaws, hardening systems, and validating security controls in production-like environments.

My approach integrates professional engineering standards with proactive cybersecurity measures. I focus on reducing risks during the development lifecycle — ensuring security is a core feature of the system architecture, not an afterthought.
