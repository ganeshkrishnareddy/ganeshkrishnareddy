### 🚀 Professional Summary

I design, build, and secure modern web applications by combining full-stack engineering with application security, Linux hardening, and automation. As a final-year Computer Science student, I am focused on building secure, scalable software systems.

My work integrates full-stack development (React, Node.js, databases, cloud) with cybersecurity practices such as application security testing, Linux hardening, secure authentication, and automation. I focus on reducing real-world security risks during development — not as an afterthought, but as a core part of the engineering process.
